### Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, {{companyName}} understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, {{companyName}} is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, {{companyName}} has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for {{companyName}} Customers to support data retention laws.


-------------------
#### Applicable Standards

##### State Medical Record Laws

* [Listing of state requirements for medical record retention](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf)

---------------------
#### Data Retention Policy

* Current {{companyName}} Customers have data stored by {{companyName}} as a part of the {{companyName}} Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
	1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from {{companyName}} and/or to have {{companyName}} continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, {{companyName}} will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
	3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from {{companyName}} within 30 days, {{companyName}} removed data from {{companyName}} systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
